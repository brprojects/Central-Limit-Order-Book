```cpp
Order
    int idNumber;
    bool buyOrSell;
    int shares;
    int limit;
    int entryTime;
    int eventTime;
    Order *nextOrder;
    Order *prevOrder;
    Limit *parentLimit;

Limit  // representing a single limit price
    int limitPrice;
    int size;
    int totalVolume;
    Limit *parent;
    Limit *leftChild;
    Limit *rightChild;
    Order *headOrder;
    Order *tailOrder;

Book
    Limit *buyTree;
    Limit *sellTree;
    Limit *lowestSell;
    Limit *highestBuy;
```

The idea is to have a binary tree of Limit objects sorted by limitPrice, each of which is itself a doubly linked list of Order objects.  Each side of the book, the buy Limits and the sell Limits, should be in separate trees so that the inside of the book corresponds to the end and beginning of the buy Limit tree and sell Limit tree, respectively.  Each order is also an entry in a map keyed off idNumber, and each Limit is also an entry in a map keyed off limitPrice.

With this structure you can easily implement these key operations with good performance:

Add – O(log M) for the first order at a limit, O(1) for all others
Cancel – O(1)
Execute – O(1)
GetVolumeAtLimit – O(1)
GetBestBid/Offer – O(1)

where M is the number of price Limits (generally << N the number of orders).  Some strategy for keeping the limit tree balanced should be used because the nature of markets is such that orders will be being removed from one side of the tree as they’re being added to the other.  Keep in mind, though, that it is important to be able to update Book.lowestSell/highestBuy in O(1) time when a limit is deleted (which is why each Limit has a Limit *parent) so that GetBestBid/Offer can remain O(1).
